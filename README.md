# Multimodal Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-ARAG)

This repository provides the implementation of **Multimodal Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Internal Representation Learning**.  
The project investigates how **internal hidden representations** can be leveraged to decide whether retrieval is necessary in multimodal question answering (VQA) tasks.

We conduct experiments with **three different backbone models** across **three benchmark datasets**:
- **OK-VQA**
- **InfoSeek**
- **E-VQA**
